# XI Launcher

A FFXI launcher that can manage profiles to connect to different servers and allows private servers to provide install and updates which the launcher will then manage.

If using Ashita v4, it will sandbox each server/install. If using Windower, you will have to run it with a regular FFXI install that's set up in the Windows registry.
